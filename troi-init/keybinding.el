;;; keybinding.el --- key bindings that aren't in specific use-packages  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; where possible i try to keep bindings with specific packages, but
;; those that aren't are here.

;;; Code:


;; based on a post by enzu.ru at medium, i'm changing a few keys
;; around but i probably won't switch to swiper just yet. i find that
;; i don't naturally use the default emacs cursor movement keys, and
;; just use the arrow keys instead. i'd probably use the vi style keys
;; with a modifier if they weren't already used elsewhere. arrows seem
;; quick enough to me.
;;
;; i am using more vimish c-f and c-b for screen scrolling.
