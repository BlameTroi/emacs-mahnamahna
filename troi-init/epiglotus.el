;;; epiglotus.el --- eglot and friends   -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; eglot is to winning me over as it's easier to manage for the places
;; i use it. it's not as polished as lsp-mode, but it's smaller. i
;; think treesitter actually handles some of what lsp-mode gets used
;; for better anyway.

;; language server program configuration goes here even though you
;; want to think of that in the context of the specific language
;; settings elsewhere throughout this init.

;; flymake lags flycheck in many areas, but its integration with eglot
;; makes it an obvious choice since i don't need the languages and
;; features suppported by flycheck.

;;; Code:


;; i'm lean toward minimalism, but i'm not a luddite. probably the
;; thing i do here that might be considered odd is turning off all
;; lsp formatting. not all servers do it, the configuration would
;; likely be a nightmare to manage (see clangd and clang-format),
;; and in some cases they don't over styles i use or find tolerable.
