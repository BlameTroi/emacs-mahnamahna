;;; shellac.el --- terminal and eshell -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; eat is apparently a very good all emacs terminal emulator, giving it a try and
;; also collecting any tweaks i make for eshell here.

;;; Code:


;;(use-package eat
;;  :defer t
;;  :hook
;;  (eshell-load . eat-eshell-mode)
;;  (eshell-load . eat-eshell-visual-command-mode))


(provide 'shellac)
;;; shellac.el ends here
