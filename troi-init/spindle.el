;;; spindle.el --- does anyone remember do not fold spindle or mutilate?  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; it's simple and works for me by highlighting what i want folded.
;; TODO i'm only using M-x right now. there are default keybindings i may
;; learn but i need to revisit if i want to use the z style keybinds
;; from vim.

;;; Code:


(use-package vimish-fold)


(provide 'spindle)
;;; spindle.el ends here
