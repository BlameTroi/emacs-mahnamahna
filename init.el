;;; init.el --- troy brumley's init.el -*- lexical-binding: t -*-


;;; Commentary:

;; just an init file. if you are running with flycheck/flymake, it
;; will report several false positives. this init turns on flymake
;; globally, so you see the warnings. flycheck and flymake aren't
;; meant for init style elisp, but i leave it on to get in the habit
;; of checking lint warnings.

;; * review this literate config, it's pretty clean and clear:
;;   https://whhone.com/emacs-config/

;; i am aware of the formatting preference of no dangling close
;; parens, but i sometimes leave the closing paren in use-package
;; blocks on its own line for the sake of error avoidance when working
;; on the settings and for clarity in diff output. when i'm done
;; tweaking i may undangle them if i see them.

;; breaking out sections to separately loadable files to help with
;; organization. i had a bad habit of not making sure additions to my
;; init.el were in the right place and i hope this keeps me honest.

;; the troi-init subdirectory is not in my load-path so the load by
;; file instead of require approach is used. while flymake complains
;; if i don't have a proper file footer with (provide 'whatever), i
;; wonder if that is still needed when doing things this way?

;; finally -- customization

;; end of init.el. setting a specific custom file name will have any
;; customizations logged into that file but i never load it. the file
;; could be in .gitignore but can be mined for changes to pull into
;; init.el.
